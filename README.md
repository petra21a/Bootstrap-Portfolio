## Assignment Challenge
In this assignment, we created two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last week with a mobile-responsive layout.
## Technical Approach
- The challenges to this assignment using an existing Framework to match a very specific format style, and introduction to mobile responsiveness.
- Key takeaway was existing frameworks allow for a quick, polished look, but can become a limiting factor when the format requirements are very specific and at odds with the default modes and styles provided.
- The deployed link above is for the Bootstrap version of the Portfolio page, and the activity I found the more challenging of the two.
